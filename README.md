# DeepLearningTemplate
Template I use for most deep learning applications.

## File structure

    figures/                - Directory for (evaluation) figures (.png/.svg/.jpg/.gif/.mp4)

    models/                 - Directory for saved model files (.pt) (checkpoints)

    notebooks/              - Directory for Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)

    results/                - Directory for results (.csv)

    src/                    - Source code directory
        models/                 - Directory for model source code

        plotting/               - Directory for code used to generate plots

        utils/                  - Directory for utility code

    main.py                 - Main access point to the system. Should have (at least) an argument parser
